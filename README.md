# Optimization-Algorithm of PSO
This program is using the object-oriented methods of Matlab to realize the algorithm of PSO, which has strong capacity to get the global optimization.
The test function here is:
y=(x(1)-1.4)^2+(x(2)-x(1))^2;
which can get its minimum value 0 in the point (1.4, 1.4).

And here is the animation video of the PSO runing process:

As we can see in the video,the blue points are the Particle Swarm, the red point represents the best point which can get the minimum function value. After several steps, the algorithm gives un the best point (1.41,1.32) which is already really close to the analytic solution (1.4,1.4).(If we can wait longer,we can the result more precise)
