# Optimization-Algorithm of PSO
This program is using the object-oriented methods of Matlab to realize the algorithm of PSO, which has strong capacity to get the global optimization.
The test function here is:
y=(x(1)-1.4)^2+(x(2)-x(1))^2;
which can get its minimum value 0 in the point (1.4, 1.4).

And here is the animation video of the PSO runing process:
